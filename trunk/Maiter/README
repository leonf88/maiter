-- OVERVIEW

-- PREREQUISITES

To build and use Piccolo, you will need a minimum of the following:

* CMake (> 2.6)
* OpenMPI
* Python (2.*)
* gcc/g++ (> 4)
* protocol buffers

If available, the following libraries will be used:

* Python development headers; SWIG
* TCMalloc
* google-perftools

In addition to these, Piccolo comes with several support libraries which are 
compiled as part of the build process; these are:

* google-flags
* google-logging


On debian/ubuntu, the required libraries can be acquired by running:

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake g++ libboost-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-thread-dev liblzo2-dev libnuma-dev libopenmpi-dev libprotobuf-dev libcr-dev libibverbs-dev openmpi-bin protobuf-compiler liblapack-dev
 
the optional libraries can be install via:

sudo apt-get install libgoogle-perftools-dev python-dev swig

-- BUILDING

To build, simply run 'make' from the toplevel piccolo directory.  After building
output should be available in the bin/ directory.  Specifically, a successful
build should generate a bin/{debug,release}/examples/example-dsm binary.

-- RUNNING

To execute a Piccolo program, you will need to modify conf/mpi-cluster
to point to the set of machines Piccolo will be executed on - for example, a file
might look like:

localhost slots=1
a slots=4
b slots=4
c slots=4

Which would allow for running up to 12 workers (+ 1 master process).
